#Hashes
#an unordered, object-indexed collection of objects (or key-value pairs)
#Array is ordered vs has is unordered.
#We can't count on the order of the things in a hash
#instead of keeping track of the positions, we track the value
#Hashes work like hanging file folders. Each folder has a label.
#we have to thumb through the folders to find the label.
#Array: phone bill is in pocket 1, hashes: find phone bill label.
