#Constants
#
#Not used in Ruby all that often
#Used a lot like variables.
# => not true objects
# => point to objects.
#Constant is constant. It stays the same. Variables change overtime!

test = 1
# 1
TEST = 2
# 2
test
# 1
TEST
# 2

#anything that begins with a capital letter is a constant!

Hello = 10
# 10

test = 100
# 100

TEST = 100
#warning, already initialized constant TEST
TEST
# 100
