# VARIABLES
#
# Variables are not objects
# Variables allows us to easily reference objects in Ruby
# Variables will be undefined or act like an object

x = 1
x + 2

## 3
## x is an object, 2 is an object

first_variable = 3

# We make it more reable like the English language.
# articles_written = 100 vs. aw_counter = 100

var = 1
a = 100
b = a
##100

b
##100

a = 50
##50

b
